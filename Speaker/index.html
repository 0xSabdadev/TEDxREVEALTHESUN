                    Aqilani </span> is a 13-year-old young environmental activist who has a high concern for
                  imported waste pollution, rubbish in rivers and seas. At first, her actions in fighting for the
                  environment were caused by Aeshnina's concern about the amount of garbage in the neighborhood
                  around her house. <br> <br>
                  Aeshnina is well known for her bravery for her actions in which she sent letters to some high-
                  level figures in the world such as <span style="color: #E62B1E;">Donald Trump</span> and <span
                    style="color: #E62B1E;">Prime Minister of Australia</span> in order for
                  them to cultivate waste in their own countries, also taking their waste back from Indonesia.
                  She is also invited by several of high-level figures in Indonesia such as Governor of West
                  Java, Ganjar Pranowo; Minister of Social Affairs, Tri Rismaharini; and President of
                  Indonesia, <span style="color: #E62B1E;">Joko Widodo</span> . Aside from gaining attention for her
                  deed in Indonesia, Aeshnina
                  also attracts international media portals, namely Al-Jazeera and Sydney Morning Herald. <br> <br>
                  Currently, Aeshnina is in the process of building a museum of imported waste near her home,
                  while also striving to maintain the cleanliness of Brantas River from plastic waste pollution
                  through <span style="color: #E62B1E;">@river.warrior</span> . Moreover, Aeshnina is actively doing an
                  online environmental
                  campaign by writing petitions and spreading information through <span
                    style="color: #E62B1E;">@info.mistik</span> .

                  Rudolf Puspa’s love toward theater started back when he studied theater with Arifin C.
                  Noer in Yogyakarta. This experience became the main reason for Rudolf Puspa to devote

                  now, he is still fully active as the <span style="color:#E62B1E;">Director of Teater Keliling</span> .
                  There are more than 200
                  drama scripts and thousands of plays that he had directed for the time being. Until now,
                  Rudolf Puspa still gives his best and live to the fullest by being the director of Teater
                  Keliling.
